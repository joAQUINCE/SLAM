To run the code, place the map files in the 'data' folder and run the enclosed
Jupyter Notebooks.

Odometry Notebook: ec833_project3_odomety.IPYNB


SLAM Notebook: ec833_project3_SLAM.IPYNB
Adjust the 'downsample' from 1-10 to pick between 108 and 1080 random angle readings.
Lower picks make the code run faster but reduce accuracy.
